## Environment Requirements

- Ubuntu OS
- Python >= 3.8 (Anaconda3 is recommended)
- PyTorch 1.7+
- A Nvidia GPU with cuda 11.1+

## Datasets

We user three popular datasets Amazon-book, Last-FM, and Yelp2018 to conduct experiments.
* We follow the paper "[KGAT: Knowledge Graph Attention Network for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07854)" to process data.
* In order to construct cold-start scenario, we find user registration time, item publication time or first interaction time in the full version of recommendation datasets. Then we divide new and old ones in chronological order. 
* For Amazon-book, download book reviews (5-core) from [here](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon), put it into related `rawdata` folder.
* For Last-FM, download LFM-1b dataset from [here](http://www.cp.jku.at/datasets/LFM-1b/), unzip and put it into related `rawdata` folder.
* For Yelp2018, download Yelp2018 version dataset from [here](https://www.heywhale.com/mw/dataset/5ecbc342fac16e0036ec41a0),  unzip and put it into related `rawdata` folder.

The prepared folder structure is like this:

```
- Datasets
    - pretrain
    - amazon-book
	- rawdata
		- reviews_Books_5.json.gz
    - last-fm
    	- rawdata
    		- LFM-1b_albums.txt
    		- LFM-1b_artists.txt
    		- ...
    - yelp2018
    	- rawdata
    		- yelp_academic_dataset_business.json
    		- yelp_academic_dataset_checkin.json
    		- ...
```

## Train

1. Now, we have provided the cold-start scenario data of last-fm. The codes for constructing the other datasets is as follows.
   ```shell
   python construct_data.py
   ```

2. Start training
   
   Here, we have provided the "meta-model" after meta-training, so you can adapt directly to cold-start scenarios.
   ```shell
   python main.py --dataset last-fm --use_meta_model True
   ```
   You can also retrain the entire model.
   ```shell
   python main.py --dataset last-fm --use_meta_model False
   ```
